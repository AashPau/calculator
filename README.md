# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Project Description

Trying to build react Calculator to test my skills

update - fixed handle on dot and handle on operator, basic calculator is ready, plan to add more features and fix the css, make it look more attractive

update 2 - fixed the operators click, added comment to the function, calculator still allows number like "2.2.2.2", need to fix it

update 3 - finally fixed all issues of handle on dot, next is to seperate "%" from other operators as it is calculated differently, and the eval method seems risky needs to change alot of things

update 4 - added some css and google font

update 5 - fix the height of display, remove css from App.css, fix the percentage button issue

update 6 - fix the (00/0) error and added error handler using try catch

update 7 - show some effect on buttons click through css and fix the issue on clicking "=" while display === "".
